#Mockina

[Mockina][Mockina] is based on a game from the early 90's. The idea is to preset the movement of a robot in order to pick up batteries. You are given an initial 8 moves and can call upon a subroutine to increase your total moves by 8, up until you reach 64 moves.

Mockina is a solo project by Craig Scott
